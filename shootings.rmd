# Overview & Data Sources

The following visualizes indiscriminate mass shootings in the United States since 1982. 

These data derive from an [open source database](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/) assembled by U.S. magazine *Mother Jones*, which defines "indiscriminate rampages" as having four or more victims and which "exclude[s] shootings stemming from more conventionally motivated crimes such as armed robbery or gang violence" ([Follman et al. 2019](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/07/mass-shootings-map/)).

Instead, these massacres address the influences of these growing phenomena, "from the firearms used and mental health factors to the growing copycat problem" (ibid.).

# Visualizing Massacres

While similar to the original [interactive map](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/07/mass-shootings-map/) by *Mother Jones*, the popup data provided in the below map (`Map I`) includes additional data, including article links, total injured victims and fatalities, city and state, weapons and weapon details, e.g. modifications, and both race and gender of the shooter(s).

**How to Use this Map****:** Each circle in the below map represents one mass shooting, while the size of the circle indicates total fatalities per incident. Use your mouse wheel or the `+` or `-` icons to zoom in and out. Click and drag the map to move the window in different directions. Click a circle to view the details of the shooting.
